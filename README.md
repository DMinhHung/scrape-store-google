Introduction
ScrapeStoreGoogleMapJob in Yii2 is used to perform scraping of store information from Google based on the selected distance and search query. It calculates the search ranking of stores located near a specific place using grid points generated around the target coordinates (latitude and longitude). The job then processes each grid point to find nearby stores and checks their ranking in the search results.
